  "description": "A circuit breaker is a design pattern used to detect failures and encapsulate the logic of preventing a failure from constantly recurring. Itâ€™s a way to manage failure and latency in distributed systems. The circuit breaker helps prevent the system from being overwhelmed by continuous failures by temporarily stopping calls to the failing service after a certain failure threshold (50% in this case) is reached. It periodically tests the service to see if it has recovered and resumes normal operations once the service is healthy again.",
